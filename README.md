# Code and Data Repository for "A Field Experiment on Business Opposition to the U.S.-China Trade War"


This Github repository contains the code and data necessary to fully replicate the paper ["A Field Experiment on Business Opposition to the U.S.-China Trade War"](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/435u9/) by Lindsay Dolan, Robert Kubinec, Daniel Nielson and Jack Zhang. A brief desciption of the available files is as follows:

  - `reproduce_results.Rmd` - This Rmarkdown file can reproduce the main results in the paper. Tables are put in the `tables/` folder and figures in the `figures` folder.
  - `main.tex` - This is the Latex code for our article.
  - `data/` - The data folder contains 4 de-identified datasets from our paper. It also includes `beapretties.rds`, which is our dataset of input tariff amounts used in the experiment. All files are saved as R data objects (RDS) files.
  - Additional plots/images are included for the paper.
